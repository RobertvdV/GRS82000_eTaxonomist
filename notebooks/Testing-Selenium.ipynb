Study in Dabie Mts, C China, found that conifer-broadleaf mixed forest is used preferentially in all seasons, as are mature fir plantations and shrubby vegetation, with males moving far from shrubby edges, while young fir plantations are used preferentially during the breeding season at the scale of the home range; at a locality in Hubei, Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantations were the dominant habitat type within the home ranges of males and their core areas. Introduced populations in Europe generally thrive best in mature lowland forest, principally broadleaf\\xa0  but sometimes evergreen, with males apparently venturing into open edges and adjacent farmland more frequently than females; in contrast, farmland (except its edges) is generally shunned within the species’ native range.

       "  '\\nVULNERABLE. Mace Lande: Endangered. Was formerly considered to be perhaps the most threatened pheasant in China. However, recent surveys suggest population of 2500–10,000 mature individuals within overall range of 532,000 km²; declining, with evidence from an extensive recent interview-based survey with local people at 86 sites suggesting that species might have been extirpated at 46% of these and that numbers have decreased at a similar number due to habitat loss, poaching and poisoning. Since mid 1980s, object of much survey and research effort by several Chinese ornithologists at Beijing Natural History Museum and Academia Sinica. Has suffered widespread deforestation in mountains of C China, and this continues; also from over-exploitation for various purposes. Historical range has contracted by c. 50%, and species has been absent from N Qinling, Hebei and Shanxi for more than ten years; still occurs in Guizhou, NE Yunnan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, S Gansu, Hunan, Henan, Hubei and Anhui, but all populations small, with just 20–50 birds recorded at many sites. Now known from at least 14 protected areas, including Fanjingshan and Badagongshan National Nature Reserves, some of which are very small. One of largest populations may be in Tuoda Forest Reserve, created in May 1992 as result of research and conservation efforts by Wu Zhi kang. Surveys of Dongzhai National Nature Reserve in 2008–2009 yielded densities of 0·125 individuals/ha and 0·126 individuals/ha, respectively, lower than in 2005, with an estimated total of c. 1000 birds. With so many populations comprising so few individuls, regular, preferably annual, monitoring is very important, as is assessment of ecological requirements, so that effective management can be initiated. Establishment of network of additional protected areas badly needed, combined with a public awareness programme which could use present species as flagship for habitat conservation. Species heavily dependent on natural forest. Tail-feathers have long been used in head-dresses in traditional Peking Opera performances; a captive population in China could satisfy this culturally important market, but other poaching, especially in unprotected areas also occurs. European introductions commenced from the mid 1800s; England\\xa0  in 1867, France   \\n\\n in 1868 and Belgium in 1889. Some introduced populations are well established, e.g. that in Czech Republic numbered c. 2500 individuals in 1985, but subsequently had reportedly declined to just 200–400 birds; and in C & NW France, where the population is estimated at 1000–1500 pairs, although at least some subpopulations are subject to considerable restocking, the species being a favourite quarry of hunters. USA introductions were apparently imported from France. Some other non-native populations are decidedly less robust, e.g. just scattered reports of individuals in British Isles, principally in S & E England, since 1990s and no evidence that population is self-sustaining.')]"
