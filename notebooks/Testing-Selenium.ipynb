A male cardinal showing yellow coloration over the whole body had no red carotenoid pigments identified in its plumage, only yellow carotenoid pigments: lutein, 3’-dehydrolutein, canary-xanthophyll B, and canary-xanthophyll A. McGraw et al. suggested the individual might have lacked enzymes necessary for conversion of yellow carotenoids to red forms. McGraw et al. fed captive male cardinals a seed diet that they determined contained only the carotenoids lutein, zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin and β-carotene. Carotenoids in the feathers grown by these males included α-doradexanthin, astaxanthin, canthaxanthin, and adonirubin. The authors noted that breast feathers grown by males in captivity were less densely pigmented than those of wild caught males (73\\n\\tMcGraw, K. J., G. E. Hill, R. Stradi, and R. S. Parker.

Northern Cardinals show an unusually low proportion of breeding birds captured molting at MAPS stations. Low capture rates of molting cardinals could be due to the reclusive behavior of molting cardinals; Pyle et al. suggested the alternate hypothesis that cardinals might disperse from breeding territories for the molting period, but we have found no direct evidence for this in the populations we have studied.
