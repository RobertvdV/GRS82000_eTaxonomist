\section{Introduction}

Deep Learning allows for incredible applications from the automatic classification of text and images, natural language processing to reinforcement learning.
In a lot of cases, deep learning models have already surpassed human experts.
While the results of the models are incredible, the reasoning behind the results remains a mystery \cite{li_interpretable_2021}.
Deep learning models often consist of millions (or even billions) of parameters, and their behaviour is often referred to as a 'back box'.
With sensitive fields, like health care, financial classification, autonomous driving, this black box behaviour could raise issues as it hampers the trustworthiness of the models \cite{carvalho_machine_2019}.





\section{Research Gap}

Different algorithms have been proposed to increase the interpretation of the models, were feature reduction algorithms \cite{ribeiro_why_2016} or inference of training sample contribution \cite{koh_understanding_2020}.
These algorithms do explain some of the
